# Touchfree Augmented Interface
- The objective of this project is to incorporate exisiting pre-trained TensorFlow model to navigate a customizable application. This allows us to transform devices with cameras into touchfree devices. 
- Users are able to use a set of hand-gestures that are mapped onto actions in the application to navigate and select options.
- This prototype implementation is of an application that can do imaging room booking. 
- This project is still a work in progress with many more features and implementations to be added.
