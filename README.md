# Touchfree Augmented Interface
- The objective of this project is to incorporate exisiting pre-trained TensorFlow model to navigate a customizable application.
- This allows us to transform devices with cameras into touchfree devices. 
- This is a prototype implementation where an application to do an imaging room booking. 
- This project is still a work in progress with many more features and implementations to be added.
